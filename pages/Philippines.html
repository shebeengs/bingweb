                    The Philippines has two distinct seasons, wet and dry. The dry season starts from November until June – these months are considered as the best time to travel to most destinations in the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wet season, on the other hand, is from July to October. During this time, an average of nine typhoons hit the Philippines and may cause flooding and landslides in some areas.

                    When typhoons hit, the majority of the islands in the country are affected, making trips around the country (depending on where the typhoon hits) a little difficult. Expect flight delays and even cancellations in some cases.

                <p>
                    Before planning a trip to the Philippines, it's important to know where your chosen destinations are because your transportation, schedule, and budget will highly depend on the distances between each place.

                <p>
                    If you're outside the Philippines, your first destination will most likely be Manila, the Philippine capital, which is located in Luzon.  Most connecting flights to other destinations in the countries continue from Manila.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The island group of Luzon also includes other big islands and island groups like Palawan, Batanes, Baguio, and Vigan among others. Top Luzon activities include city sightseeing, beach adventures, and some island-hopping trips.

                <p>
                    Visayas is located in the central part of the Philippines. Cebu is the main gateway to other Visayas destinations. In Visayas is where you can also find other destinations like Boracay, Bohol, Iloilo, Negros Region, Leyte, and Siquijor. The top attractions and activities in Visayas are idyllic beaches, island-hopping, outdoor adventures, and food trips.

Some destinations in Mindanao include Siargao, Camiguin, Zamboanga, and Cagayan de Oro to name a few. Top things to do in Mindanao include outdoor adventures, beach escapades, and island-hopping.

                    The primary way of going around the Philippines is by buses, planes, and ships/ferries. Boat rides are great for short distances; for everywhere else, flights are recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on when you visit, you can find a lot of cheap flights in the Philippines. In fact, sometimes it’s cheaper to book a flight than a ferry. The biggest flight carriers are Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific Air, and AirAsia.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within small towns and cities, the primary mode of transportation is by bus, jeepney, or tricycle (like Thailand’s tuktuk or India’s auto-rickshaw, but smaller). In addition, major cities would have taxi cabs and the Grab app. Only Manila has the metro system.

                    Many visitors skip the capital city of Manila and only go here as a jump-off point for their forward destination in the country. Like any metropolis, it’s big and populated. However, this bustling city is worth exploring for at least a day or two. It has a number of interesting attractions and activities that would appeal especially to visitors.

                    You can also try some of the trips around Binondo, the oldest Chinatown in the world. Want to sit by the bay and have a beer? You can watch one of the best sunsets in the Philippines along the Manila Bay at the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When booking a hotel, we recommend booking accommodations either in Manila City or in Makati City. Both of these destinations have plush hotels, high-end shopping malls, and a variety of bars and restaurants that offer a range of local and international cuisines.

                    The island province of Palawan definitely deserves its title as one of the world’s most beautiful islands and one of the best places to visit in the Philippines. You will see it for yourself once you go island hopping in Palawan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll see beautiful powdery, white sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, towering limestones, hidden lagoons, and even a safari. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puerto Princesa, the capital of Palawan, is often the first place that travelers go to, as it has frequent and affordable flights to and from Manila and Cebu. The city is the jump-off point for Honda Bay island hopping, Underground River tours, and several Palawan destinations like El Nido and San Vicente.

                    Coron is another very popular destination in Palawan. There are direct flights and boats from Manila to Coron (via Busuanga Airport, an hour from Coron town proper), which makes it a possible first destination for the Palawan leg of your Philippine itinerary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re into water activities, Coron is the getaway you might be looking for. It is best known for wreck diving and snorkeling, island hopping to hidden lagoons surrounded by towering limestone cliffs, and the iconic Kayangan Lake.

                <p>
                    El Nido is another well-known destination in Palawan. The town has transformed over the years, from one that doesn’t even have an ATM and 24-hour electricity into a popular holiday destination.
                </p>
                <p>
                There are regular island-hopping trips in El Nido that take you to various islands and beaches such as the Hidden Beach, Big Lagoon, Small Lagoon, Hidden Lagoon, Paradise Beach, and Natnat Beach, among others. When visiting El Nido, you can choose from tour A, tour B, tour C, or tour D during your visit, as operators offer very similar prices. You also have the option to rent a boat with a guide and boatman to customize your trip.

                    Boracay became a popular destination for both local and foreign travelers because of its fine, white sandy beaches (led by the famous White Beach), its combination of a party and family-friendly atmosphere, its many accommodations across budgets.

                <p>
                    Watching sunsets may be cliché to some, but the sunset in Boracay is definitely one of the best you’ll see in the country. The silhouette of sailboats, the shadows of people walking along the shore, and the sky turning from blue to a fiery red and into a faint orange is an image you won’t quickly forget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's why a luxury sunset yacht cruise tour is a must-try on the island. You can also try other fun activities in Boracay's White Beach like wakeboarding, parasailing, paraw sailing, paddle boarding, helmet diving, speedboat riding, banana boat ride, and jet ski experience.

                <p>The province of Cebu is another popular place to visit for both locals and foreigners alike because of the range of natural, historical, and cultural attractions it offers. </p>
        
                <p>Bantayan Island and Malapascua Island in the north are famous beach destinations in Cebu because of their pristine beaches and sky blue waters. Visitors usually combine a trip to these two destinations. Both islands provide a laid back atmosphere if you want to just spend the whole day relaxing. </p>
        
                <p>Make sure to go to the south of Cebu as well and include Moalboal in your Philippine itinerary. This is where you should be if you want to experience the famous sardine run tour. Seeing the hundreds of thousands of sardines swimming beneath you (or above you if you choose to dive) is definitely an awesome experience unique to Cebu.</p>

                <p>Bohol has many beaches and activities for those who want to see more of the region. Make sure to explore Panglao Island to make your trip more fun and exciting! Start your trip by trying Alona Beach activities such as fly fish, UFO, parasailing, banana boat ride, and many more.</p>
        
                <p>A trip to Bohol is incomplete without checking out Chocolate Hills trips. These green hills that turn brown during the summer months will remind you of Hershey’s Kisses, hence the name. The viewpoint was affected by the major earthquake in 2015, but it has since been restored.</p>
